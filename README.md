<h1>Road Accident Severity Index Prediction - Monsoon 2023</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>

<p>This repository contains the code and resources for the "Road Accident Severity Index Prediction" Project, conducted during the Monsoon semester of 2023.</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to predict the severity of traffic based on various factors such as weather conditions, road conditions, time of day, and more. This is particularly relevant during the monsoon season, where weather conditions can significantly impact road safety.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Preprocessing</strong>: The project includes scripts for cleaning and preprocessing the accident data, handling missing values, outliers, and more.</li>
  <li><strong>Feature Engineering</strong>: The scripts for feature engineering help in creating meaningful features that can improve the performance of the machine learning model.</li>
  <li><strong>Model Training and Evaluation</strong>: The project uses various machine learning algorithms to train models on the preprocessed data. It also includes scripts for evaluating the performance of these models using appropriate metrics.</li>
  <li><strong>Prediction</strong>: The final part of the project involves using the trained model to predict the severity index of road accidents.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>To use this project, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README file. You will need Python and several data science libraries installed on your machine.</p>
